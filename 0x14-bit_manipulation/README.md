## C - Bit manipulation
> Bit manipulation is the procss whereby we algorithmically manipulate bits, or change the bits asigned to a particular variable.
> In this project I will write programs that manipulates the bits using the Bitwise Operators.
> The bitwise operators to use are; &, |, ~, >>, <<.


### General Requirements
* files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* The coding style to use is [Betty Style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl)


### Files Descriptions
0. a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1. a function that prints the binary representation of a number
2. a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
3. a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4. a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5. a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
6. a function that checks the endianness
7. generating a password to a file


### Relevant Sites
* To check [Endianness](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)
* Password to [open](https://medium.com/@rickharris_dev/reverse-engineering-using-linux-gdb-a99611ab2d32) a program with help of [ASCII](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ascii-to-text) conversion to text.
